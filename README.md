**Differentiable optical propagation and inverse design in Julia**

FluxOptics.jl is a high-performance Julia package for simulating scalar optical field propagation with full support for automatic differentiation. Design and optimize complex optical systems using gradient-based methods.

## ‚ú® Features

- üåä **Multiple propagation methods**: Angular Spectrum, Rayleigh-Sommerfeld, Collins integral, Beam Propagation Method
- üé≠ **Rich component library**: Phase masks, amplitude masks, diffractive optical elements (DOEs)
- üéØ **Optimization-first design**: Fully differentiable with Zygote and Enzyme via ChainRulesCore
- üîß **Advanced regularization**: Proximal operators for constrained optimization
- üìä **Built-in metrics**: Power coupling, field overlap, intensity matching
- üöÄ **GPU acceleration**: Seamless CUDA.jl integration for large-scale simulations
- üß© **Composable systems**: Build complex optical systems with intuitive piping syntax

## üì¶ Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("FluxOptics")

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Capabilities

### Multi-Wavelength Support

```julia
# Propagate multiple wavelengths simultaneously
Œªs = [0.8, 1.064, 1.55]
u_multi = ScalarField(data, (2.0, 2.0), Œªs)
propagator = ASProp(u_multi, 1000.0)
result = propagate(u_multi, propagator, Forward)
```

### Off-Axis Propagation

```julia
# Track tilted beams through optical systems
u_tilted = ScalarField(data, (2.0, 2.0), 1.064; tilts=(0.05, 0.02))
propagator = ASProp(u_tilted, 1000.0; track_tilts=true)
result = propagate(u_tilted, propagator, Forward)
```

### GPU Acceleration

```julia
using CUDA

# Move field to GPU
u_gpu = cu(u)

# All operations work seamlessly on GPU
propagator = ASProp(u_gpu, 1000.0)
result_gpu = propagate(u_gpu, propagator, Forward)
```

### Constrained Optimization

```julia
# Apply constraints during optimization with proximal operators
prox_rule = ProxRule(Optimisers.Adam(0.01), constraint_function)
opt_state = setup(prox_rule, params)
update!(opt_state, params, grads)
```
